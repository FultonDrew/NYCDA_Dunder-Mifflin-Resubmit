	<div id='left'>
		<h1 id="aboutH1">About Us</h1>
		<div id='aboutCopy'>Michael Scott Paper Company was created to service the Scranton, Pennsylvania area with the highest quality paper products and the best customer service known to mankind. We have over 20 years of paper industry expereience, learning from the wonderful training program that Dunder Mifflin provides. Adapting and tweaking those methods has allowed us to provide our own special type of service. <br>
    Led by Michael Scott, our fearless visionary, we have created a company culture of blunders and nonsense. We enjoy making the occasional paper sale in between having fun in the office. We typically like to prank eachother, discuss bullshit and gossip about the disgusting rat, Toby Flenderson.

			<span id='namePosition'>Michael Scott <br>'CEO'</span><br>Our fearless leader was born and raised here in Scranton, Pennsylvania and has Scranton paper in his blood. He has been in this industry for the last 25 years, and has always succeeded in building wonderful client relationships and selling the shit out of paper.</div>

		<div id='description'>
			<span id='namePosition'>Pam Beasley<br>'Saleswoman'</span><br>Pam started out as our hot receptionist, and somehow talked her way up into being a saleswoman for the MSPC. With her amazing organizational and communication skills, Pam was a wonderful addition to our team. She is loved by us all (especially Michael) and will undoubtedly be there for you day or night -- unless she has to take care of CeCe while Jim is working.

			<span id='namePosition'>Jim Halpert<br>'Salesman'</span><br>Jim has been our best salesman in the company since he joined us fresh out of college. Jim was born and raised here in Scranton, Pennsylvania and has Scranton paper in his blood. He will always be there day and night to help solve all of your paper needs.

		<div id='description'>
			<span id='namePosition'>Ryan Howard<br>'Intern'</span><br>Ryan is an idiot and a know-it-all. He is the apple of Michael's eye, and they have an odd non-sexual, man-love relationship. Ryan thinks he is better than the rest of the team, but no one actually thinks that. Ryan should probably be fired, but Michael keeps him around so that he feels young, hip and cool. Ryan wants to move up in the company, but he should probably stop sleeping with the Customer Service Reps first.

		<div id='description'>
			<span id='namePosition'>Creed Bratton<br>'Unsure'</span><br>No one is quite sure what Creed does, or if that's even his fucking name. Creed just sits there and asks us all weird would you rather questions that seem oddly like he is actually pondering doing either scenario. His last job, at Dunder Mifflin, he was the QC department and had many incidents that led him to being fired.

			<span id='namePosition'>Phyllis Vance, Vance Refrigeration<br>'Saleswoman'</span><br>Phyllis is the grandmother of the team, yet throws the best office parties. Her style is amazing, which we feel will seduce you to purchasing our paper. Phyllis was the highest selling napkin saleswoman in the eastern region for the Michael Scott Paper Company, which we are so proud of her for.

			<div id='productName'>Napkins</div><br>The napkins that we sell here at Michael Scott Paper Company are the softest, single-ply napkin on the market. We first line each sheet of paper with felt to get that beautiful pool table feel on every wipe. The crumbs in the corners of your mouth stand no chance to the grit that these napkins possess. We proudly test each napkin against BBQ sauce, mustard and red wine before packaging and shipping them to you. This process is unrivaled from any of our competitors, especially the lower-quality paper company, Dunder Mifflin.</div>
